## About

Phost is a email debugging tool and local SMTP server, developed primarily in PHP. 
Instead of sending your development emails to Mailtrap or MailHog, you can use Phost to debug your emails inside a beautiful self-contained desktop app.

We leverage a powerful stack of modern technologies:

-   [**Laravel/Livewire**](https://livewire.laravel.com/) -> For dynamic, reactive interface
-   [**NativePHP**](https://nativephp.com/) -> Electron wrapper for PHP built apps
-   [**ReactPHP**](https://reactphp.org/) -> Powering the SMTP server component

While Phost may not yet match the feature set (or stability) of some paid alternatives, it serves as an exploration of the capabilities of a native PHP stack.

[Download the latest release here](https://github.com/gwleuverink/phost/releases).

## Supporting the Project

To distribute Phost on macOS, the application needs to be signed and notarized through the Apple Developer Program, which costs â‚¬100 annually. If you find Phost useful, please consider supporting its development and maintenance through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/gwleuverink). Your support helps cover these costs and enables continued development of this open-source tool.
